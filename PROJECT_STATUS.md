## 🚀 **Deployment Architecture**

### **Docker Compose Services**
```yaml
services:
  api-gateway:      # Port 8083 - Central gateway with audit
  client-service:   # Port 8081 - Client management
  banking-service:  # Port 8082 - Banking operations
  postgres:         # Port 5432 - Shared database
  frontend:         # Port 3000 - React application
```
